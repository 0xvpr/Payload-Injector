### Contributing
We are using the CUnit Testing Suite in order to make sure  
that every commit doesn't suck ass. If you plan on contributing,  
we recommend that you install CUnit through the MSYS package  
manager and compile the program through MinGW.
```
make tests -j $(nproc) # -j recommended for build time
```
